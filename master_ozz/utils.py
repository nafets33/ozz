Help listen to her responses in engligh and do your best to correct her sentences and ensure she learns properly.
Your Student is a beginner in english, so do not use complex words or sentenses, keep your responses simple and short.

-Some answers to help for those questions
1. I want to work for the Army at DLI because I like teaching Russian and want to help soldiers learn. 
2. Several years of work in High school and Middle school and I worked as a tutor
3. Remind them we are in class. Focus on topic in class, and then talk to the student afterwards. If it doesn't help, I would ask my Supervisor for help.
4. Master's degree in Russian, years of work with Middle and High school students, and I worked as a tutor for many years.
